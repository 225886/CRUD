# CRUD
This is Harold Moran's final project for 11th grade Computer Science Principles. 
This is a website to find people's favorite golf club, options range from driver to putter.
The website is simple, all you have to do is enter your name, grade, and favorite club, then you will be thanked for your response.
The website will also be able to tell you who else had picked any certain club as their favorite.
All of this data is sent back to phpmyadmin, to a table where it can be analized. 
CRUD website created 100% through cloud9. 
Thanks for using my website!
